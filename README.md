# Bike-Demand-Prediction-Project
A machine learning project helps in predicting demand of bikes needed under certain cirucmstances.

In this we have prepared a model which can predict the price of Bike during different circumstances.
All the parameters are :-
1. Hour 
2. Hotness
3. Humidity
4. Wind Speed 
5. Visibility 
6. Solar Radiation
7. Rainfall 
8. Snowfall 
9. Seasons 
10.Holiday
11. Working Day
We did intense data analysis . Observed the trend during Weeks , Months , Weekdays and in many other way. Various models were tried and tested and finally we selected CATBOOST for our project.
