**In this we have prepared a model which can predict the price of Bike during different circumstances.**

All the parameters are :-
 1. Hour	2. Hotness	3. Humidity	 4. Wind Speed	5. Visibility	 6. Solar Radiation	 
 7. Rainfall	8. Snowfall	 9. Seasons	  10. Holiday  11.	Working Day

We did intense data analysis . Observed the trend during Weeks , Months , Weekdays and in many other way.
Various models were tried and tested and finally we selected **CATBOOST** for our project.
